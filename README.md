# ReferenceTrustableDecoding

This is the official code repository of paper ''Reference Trustable Decoding: A Training-Free Augmentation Paradigm for Large Language Models''.

**Currently work in progress**. The codes in repo can replicate all experiments in the paper, however the usage is unfriendly. More usable version is comming soon.
